# Boilerplate code to get you going.

## Description

Contained this this repo I have simple code to use to get your projects running quickly.

I suggest staring this repo to find later, or forking down a copy for yourself and updating the pieces you see fit.

## Please contribute!

I would love to see simple little explanations on how to use:

- Material UI
- Tailwind
- Sagas
- Axios examples
- ajax examples
- or other code you often copy and paste into new projects




## Prerequisites

Most of these projects require to be installed on your computer 
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)


## Installation

How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example --  Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the `.env` file.

1. Create a database named `your database name`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
